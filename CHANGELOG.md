# Changelog

## [2.3.4] - 2026-05-13

- **Fix**: DELETE operations whose OpenAPI spec defines a request body now actually send that body. Previously the generator emitted `HttpClient.DeleteAsync(url, ct)` which has no body overload, so the body was silently dropped. Generated code now uses `SendAsync(new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Delete, url) { Content = content }, ct)`. Regenerated against Apigen.Generator 2.3.1.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-05-13

- Regenerated against Apigen.Generator 2.3.0.
- All operations and interfaces now accept `CancellationToken cancellationToken = default` and propagate it through HTTP calls and content reads.
- Non-success responses now throw `ApiException` (inherits from `HttpRequestException`) exposing `StatusCode`, `Method`, `Url`, `ResponseBody`, `Headers`, and `ContentHeaders`. Existing `catch (HttpRequestException)` callers continue to work.
- Improved logging: distinct events for caller cancellation (Debug, 1004), `HttpClient.Timeout` (Error, 3002), transport failures (Error, 3003), and API errors (Error, 3001).

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-23

- Initial open-source release
- Generated C# client for Vikunja API
